How to create GitHub Page:
    1. Go to the repository of the website you want to deploy. Ensure that the respository is public.
    2. After uploading a html file named "index.html", go to the setting tab and click Pages.
    3. Ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected at the source.
    4. In the branch, select main from the dropdown and ensure the folder is set to /(root) 
    5. Click save and wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and deploy your site.
